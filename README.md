<h1> How did i deploy my portfolio ? </h1>

Started by launching Visual Studio Code and coding the first steps. 
I then create a repository to commit my work.
When I wanted to deploy my website, I juste linked my Github account with Vercel.
I then selected my repository with my work on into Vercel and my website was deployed !
After this , I installed Checkly for all of my repositories and a few extensions that I found on the Github Marketplace.
